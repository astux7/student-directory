This is the first project in MKAcademy:

In the first week we'll build a very simple Ruby script that will let us maintain a list of current students at Makers Academy. It will have the following features:

Show the list of all students
ordered by name
grouped by cohort (as an exercise)
Add new students by asking the user to input the names

In week 2 we'll expand on it to do the following

Show information about a given student
Add information related to a particular student (e.g. hobbies)
Interactive menu to ask the user what he or she would like to do
Displaying aggregate info (statistics)
Saving this data to a file
Loading it from the file

The script will be invoked from the command-line and it will only use pure Ruby, that is, there will be no external libraries to use. It will have text-based interface that will not look particularly exciting but it's really important to understand how to build basic things before trying to create sophisticated websites.
